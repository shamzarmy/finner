I found that in the Finner layout the Alt Gr keys shiftstates were mapped to
almost all the keys. This was interfering with keyboard shortcuts in many programs,
VS Code for example. Therefore, I decided to make a new version Finner2
without the Alt Gr keys which is more developer friendly.

I also wanted to map Caps Lock to Ctrl but that was unfortunately not possible
with Windows keyboard layout creator. I finally remapped the keys with
PowerToys in Windows.

What would be really cool is to get the Executable via a script so that
don't have manually import the klc file and such. Challenge for another day.

I really hope you enjoy using this layout. Happy Coding!!!
